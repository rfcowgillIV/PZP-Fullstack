This project is a recreation of my bosses current website. I work for a Full production DJ company where we mainly do weddings, however we do much much more.
I figured it would be fun doing my own take on the website while also possibly finding some ways to improve my bosses current site.

This is now the full version of my website, including a back end. The new version of my website includes a database, and updated code.

Includes a ton of new updated pics & a whole new page where people can go and write reviews!

However in order to run this project there are a few things you must do first in order to get it up and running on your machine.

Step #1

Open the project in the code editor, terminal or command line of your choice.

Step #2

Go into the root directory of the project

Step #3

Open terminal or command line depending on your machine and run the code

npm install

    - this will install the necessary packages to help run the site.

Step #4

Run the code

mongod 

    - this will start the mongo service, which provides the database and serves content to the website.


Step #5

Run the code 

nodemon 

    - this will begin the app server processing on the machine and will host the site locally on http://localhost:3030


Step #6

open your browser of choice and copy or type http://localhost:3030 this will take you to the website!

Step #7

Explore the website! Feel free to leave a review on the review page! Or leave some feedback for me on my GitHub page.
